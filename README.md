# WorldEditor
A World Editor for Minecraft Java Edition, 1.13+

# Why would I use this
If you've ever wanted to modify your inventory with items you're not supposed to get in vanilla, it's always a hassle to use NBTEditor or just vanilla commands, whereas this tool freely allows you to edit your inventory, and saves it directly into the world.

# How to use
Run the jar file in the release tab, or compile the code yourself (very easy to do)

# Supported devices
Any computer running Windows 10 or higher
Can technically be run on Linux, but I wasn't able to modify anything. Feel free to modify the code to allow linux users to use the program, but credit this project first

# What does it do?
For now, it can change a world icon, world subtitle, and change statistics of a player, their inventory and other nbt tags
# Added NBT edition
- Inventory editor
- World game rule editor
- Force hardcore
